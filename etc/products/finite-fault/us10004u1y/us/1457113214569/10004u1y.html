<h1>Preliminary Finite Fault Results for the Mar 02, 2016 Mw 7.8 Southwest of Sumatra, Indonesia
Earthquake (Version 1)</h1>
<hr/>

<h1>DATA Process and Inversion </h1>
<p>
We used GSN broadband waveforms downloaded from the NEIC waveform server.
We analyzed 50 teleseismic broadband P waveforms, 17 broadband SH waveforms, 
and 72 long period surface waves selected based on data quality and azimuthal 
distribution. Waveforms are first converted to displacement by removing the 
instrument response and are then used to constrain the slip history using a finite 
fault inverse algorithm (Ji et al., 2002). We begin modeling using a hypocenter 
matching or adjusted slightly from the initial NEIC solution (Lon. = 94.2 deg.; Lat. = 
-4.9 deg., Dep. = 24.0 km), and a fault plane defined using either the rapid W-Phase 
moment tensor (for near-real time solutions), or the gCMT moment tensor (for 
historic solutions).

Comparison of teleseismic body waves. Data are shown in black and synthetic seismograms 
are plotted in red. Both data and synthetic seismograms are aligned on the P or 
SH arrivals. The number at the end of each trace is the peak amplitude of the 
observation in micro-meters. The number above the beginning of each trace is 
the source azimuth; below is the epicentral distance. Shading describes relative 
weighting of the waveforms.

<h2>Scientific Analysis:</h2>
Because of the preponderance for north-south oriented, recently active faults in regional multibeam bathymetric data (e.g., Deplus et al., Geology, 1998), we publish here models for both the E-W and N-S nodal planes of the focal mechanism. Waveform fits between data and synthetics appear visually better for the E-W plane (see P-wave displacement data for stations with azimuths to north and east), though RMS misfits between the two models are roughly equal. Dr. Jennifer Nealy, NEIC, provided the model for the E-W plane.
