The relative motion of these crustal plates causes frequent   earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions.   Most of the   Mexican landmass is on the westward moving North American   plate. The Pacific Ocean floor south of Mexico is being   carried northeastward by the underlying Cocos plate. Because   oceanic crust is relatively dense, when the Pacific Ocean   floor encounters the lighter continental crust of the Mexican   landmass, the ocean floor is subducted beneath the North   American plate creating the deep Middle American trench   along Mexico\'s southern coast. Also as a result of this   convergence, the westward moving Mexico landmass is slowed   and crumpled creating the mountain ranges of southern Mexico   and earthquakes near Mexico\'s southern coast. As the oceanic   crust is pulled downward, it melts; the molten material is then   forced upward through weaknesses in the overlying continental   crust. This process has created a region of volcanoes across   south-central Mexico known as the Cordillera Neovolc&aacute;nica.  <\/p>  <p>  The area west of the Gulf of California, including Mexico\'s Baja   California Peninsula, is moving northwestward with the Pacific   plate at about 50 mm per year. Here, the Pacific and North American   plates grind past each other creating strike-slip faulting, the   southern extension of California\'s San Andreas fault. In the past,   this relative plate motion pulled Baja California away from the coast   forming the Gulf of California and is the cause of earthquakes in the   Gulf of California region today.  <\/p>  <p>  Mexico has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic   eruptions. In September 1985, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake killed   more than 9,500 people in Mexico City. In southern Mexico, Volc&aacute;n   de Colima and El Chich&oacute;n erupted in 2005 and 1982, respectively.   Paricut&iacute;n volcano, west of Mexico City, began venting smoke in a   cornfield in 1943; a decade later this new volcano had grown to a   height of 424 meters. Popocat&eacute;petl and Ixtacc&iacute;huatl volcanos   (&quot;smoking mountain&quot; and &quot;white lady&quot;, respectively), southeast   of Mexico City, occasionally vent gas that can be clearly seen from the City,   a reminder that volcanic activity is ongoing. In 1994 and 2000 Popocat&eacute;petl   renewed its activity forcing the evacuation of nearby towns, causing   seismologists and government officials to be concerned about the effect a   large-scale eruption might have on the heavily populated region.   Popocat&eacute;petl volcano last erupted in 2010.  <\/p>  <p>  <a href=\'http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1083/f/\' target=\'_blank\'>   More information on regional seismicity and tectonics<\/a>  <\/p>'},'cities':[{'distance':43,'direction':'NNE','name':'Camalu, Mexico','longitude':-116.06667,'latitude':30.85,'population':7425},{'distance':52,'direction':'N','name':'Colonia Vicente Guerrero, Mexico','longitude':-116,'latitude':30.75,'population':12829},{'distance':83,'direction':'SE','name':'Maneadero, Mexico','longitude':-116.56667,'latitude':31.71667,'population':17861},{'distance':98,'direction':'SE','name':'Ensenada, Mexico','longitude':-116.61667,'latitude':31.86667,'population':256565},{'distance':437,'direction':'WSW','name':'Phoenix, Arizona','longitude':-112.07404,'latitude':33.44838,'population':1445632}],'links':[{'text':'Additional earthquake information for Mexico','url':'http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/index.php?regionID=3'}],'fe':{'spanishName':'BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO','hds':'NORTH AMERICA;MEXICO;BAJA CALIFORNIA','longName':'Baja California, Mexico','number':48,'shortName':'BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO','mediumName':'BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO'},'auth':'ECX'});
